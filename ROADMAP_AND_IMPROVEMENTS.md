## 🚀 Priority Improvements for Market Readiness

### Phase 1: Core Stability & Security (Week 1-2)

#### 1.1 Authentication Enhancements

**Priority: CRITICAL**

- [ ] **Refresh Tokens**
  - Implement short-lived access tokens (15min) + long-lived refresh tokens (7 days)
  - Add `/api/admin/refresh` endpoint
  - Prevents session hijacking
- [ ] **Session Management**

  - Track active sessions per user
  - Add "Logout All Devices" functionality
  - Store session metadata (IP, user-agent, location)

- [ ] **API Keys for Devices**
  - Generate unique API keys for each TV/player
  - Separate from user authentication
  - Easy revocation without affecting other devices

```javascript
// Implementation Example
POST /api/tv/:tvId/generate-api-key
Response: { "apiKey": "tvms_live_abc123...", "expiresAt": "2025-10-18" }
```

#### 1.2 Input Validation & Sanitization

**Priority: HIGH**

- [ ] Install `joi` or `zod` for schema validation
- [ ] Validate all request bodies, params, queries
- [ ] Sanitize HTML in text widgets/tickers
- [ ] Add file type/size validation for uploads

```javascript
// Example with Zod
import { z } from "zod";

const tvSchema = z.object({
  tvId: z.string().min(3).max(50),
  name: z.string().min(1).max(100),
  resolution: z.string().regex(/^\d+x\d+$/),
  location: z.string().min(1),
});
```

#### 1.3 Database Optimization

**Priority: HIGH**

- [ ] Add indexes on frequently queried fields:

  ```javascript
  // In models
  tvId: { type: String, required: true, unique: true, index: true }
  status: { type: String, enum: ['online','offline'], index: true }
  createdAt: { type: Date, index: true }
  ```

- [ ] Implement pagination on all list endpoints

  ```javascript
  GET /api/media/recent-media?page=1&limit=20
  ```

- [ ] Add database connection pooling settings
- [ ] Implement query caching for static data (layouts, groups)

#### 1.4 Error Handling & Logging

**Priority: HIGH**

- [ ] Centralized error handler middleware
- [ ] Structured logging with `winston` or `pino`
- [ ] Error tracking integration (Sentry, Rollbar)
- [ ] Request ID tracking for debugging

```javascript
// Centralized error handler
app.use((err, req, res, next) => {
  logger.error({
    requestId: req.id,
    error: err.message,
    stack: err.stack,
    path: req.path,
    method: req.method,
  });

  res.status(err.statusCode || 500).json({
    success: false,
    message:
      process.env.NODE_ENV === "production"
        ? "Internal server error"

const campaignQueue = new Queue('campaigns', redisConfig);

// Process campaigns
campaignQueue.process(async (job) => {
  const { campaignId } = job.data;
  const campaign = await Campaign.findById(campaignId);

  // Resolve target screens (including groups)
  const screens = await resolveTargetScreens(campaign);

  // Send content to each screen via WebSocket
  screens.forEach(tvId => {
    io.to(tvId).emit('campaignStart', {
      mediaItems: campaign.mediaItems,
